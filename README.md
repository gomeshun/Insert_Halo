Insert_Halo aims to combine the publicly available codes [Sashimi-SIDM](https://github.com/shinichiroando/sashimi-si) and [pyHalo](https://github.com/dangilman/pyHalo) so that dark matter subhalos generated by Sashimi are inserted into pyHalo so that those subhalos can be used for gravitational lensing analysis through pyHalo.
This code is currently in active development, meaning it is not yet finished and will very likely contains bugs
